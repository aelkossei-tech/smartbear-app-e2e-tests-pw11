* From now on --> sell yourself and your wealth of knowledge 
    - You should be able to talk about Playwright for an extended amount of time when asked during an interview 
        - Snapshot testing + config file (more powerful than the interviewer knows) + visual regression testing 
    - Have an empty Playwright/Cypress project --> to showcase your knowledge
        - do a demo 
    - Post --> how to set up different dependencies for projects [snappify website]

RECAP: 
    - We downloaded dotenv dependency
    - baseURL + loginURL --> to properly test the features on each with auth. 
    - configs ==> enabled imports from dotenv + globalSetups [testDirectory to reporter]
        - reporter --> JUnit (for pipelines) + HTML (for local & pipelines)
